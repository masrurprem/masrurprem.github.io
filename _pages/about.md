# Selected Experience

## 📚 Independent Research and Reading Papers
As an enthusiastic learner, I allow myself to do independent research on ML and DL. That being said, I read research papers on the topic of interest carefully. I try to understand the workflow including understanding the business problem and exploring dataset availability.  Then, I try to implement the paper, at least on the basic level, to gain hands-on experience and improve my knowledge through learning by doing. You can go to my [Projects page](https://masrurprem.github.io/PROJECTS/) for more details.

## 📜 Problem-solving with C, C++, Python
My strong predilection towards Programming motivates me to learn about programming concepts and solve problems from time to time. As I have a knack for coding, I have solved over 170 problems from [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/the_bida) and still counting. Moreover, I achieved a Python gold badge from [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/masrur_883) by solving over 50 easy and medium problems in the Python programming language category. In addition, I have experience with problem-solving of significant amounts in UVA online judge.
