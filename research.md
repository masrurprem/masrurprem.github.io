## Research 1: Classifying Red Blood Cell Anomaly Using Deep Learning
*Supervisor*: Md Simul Hasan Talukder, Lecturer
Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology (DUET)
*Updates*: In this research, we are developing a Deep Learning-based system capable of classifying abnormal Red Blood Cells from cell images. The dataset contains 6088 images of normal and abnormal red blood cells with 3044 images per class. I have trained and validated a pre-trained ResNet50 architecture for this task. Currently, we are working to develop the modelâ€™s accuracy and efficient preprocessing techniques.
