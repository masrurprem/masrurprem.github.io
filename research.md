## Research 1: Classifying Red Blood Cell Anomaly Using Deep Learning

**Supervisor**: [Md Simul Hasan Talukder](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T754wTAAAAAJ&hl=en), Lecturer

Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology (DUET), Bangladesh

**Updates**: In this research, we are developing a Deep Learning-based system capable of classifying abnormal Red Blood Cells from cell images. The dataset contains 6088 images of normal and abnormal red blood cells with 3044 images per class. I have trained and validated a pre-trained ResNet50 architecture for this task. Currently, we are working to develop the modelâ€™s accuracy and efficient preprocessing techniques.
